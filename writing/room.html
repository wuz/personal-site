My soul is a room, 
That I'd like you to see
Somewhat cozy and warm
Though darker than I'd like it to be
I'd love to invite you in, 
To let in your light,
To show you around
Even just for a night.
Though I suppose that your leaving
Your light would go too
But perhaps like a candle
The lingering smell might be of you
