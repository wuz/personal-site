can we use the internet now?

I think I miss the days of having ideas and putting them online. This is weird for a couple reasons. First, that is still happening. Second, I wasn't using computers for much of the time I am talking about. The days I am thinking of are those of (non-corporate) mailing lists, of self-hosted websites - and perhaps most importantly, those days before gmail and facebook and twitter.

Maybe I should start with a story.

## Jred.net or how I learned computing and learned to love the web
Back in 2007, in a weird set of coincidences, my mom discovered [Myachi](http://myachi.com) on TV around Christmas-time. She bought them for my siblings and I, thinking it would be a fun little stocking stuffer. Little did any of us know, this random bag full of sand would change a lot about me.

Myachi, for those who don't know (read: everyone), is what is called a 'handsack'. Think of a hacky-sack, but for your hands. For a semi-chubby kid without a ton of friends, it is the perfect disctraction to spend hours and hours on after school.

One of my favorite trick videos.

The video aboove shows some of the really cool things you can do with Myachi's. Monk and Animal were two 'masters' - people employed by the company to sell the toy in toy stores in NYC. All the kids who got into Myachi dreamed of being Masters one day. Who doesn't want to get paid to play with toys?
